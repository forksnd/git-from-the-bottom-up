/* Fix for paragraph indentation issue
   See: https://github.com/jwiegley/git-from-the-bottom-up/issues/22
   
   The default theme incorrectly indents paragraphs after non-paragraph elements.
   This fix ensures that only paragraphs immediately following other paragraphs
   are indented, not paragraphs after code blocks or other elements.
